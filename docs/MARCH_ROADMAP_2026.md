# 🗺️ March 2026 — Unified Roadmap

February audit is **complete**. Now we build forward. This is the **single source of truth** for what to work on and in what order.

Ranked by: **Security > Stability > Performance > Code Quality > Features**, combined with what unblocks monetization fastest.

## 🧠 Ranking Rationale

### Why Env Validation (#3) before features?

One missing `SUPABASE_URL` on deploy = **entire app silently breaks in production**. 1 session to eliminate this risk permanently. Non-negotiable.

### Why SEO (#4) before Cashflow?

Marketing/legal pages have zero `generateMetadata`. Google can't index them properly, social shares look broken. Free discoverability win, ~1 session.

### Why Cashflow Charts (#5-6) before Testing (#7)?

Cashflow is **bare-bones** right now — 3 number cards and a table. Charts + categories transform it from a prototype to a product feature users actually want to use. Testing is critical but doesn't ship user value.

### Why Testing (#7-8) before `canAccess` (#9)?

You've refactored auth, cashflow permissions, DTOs — all untested. Without tests, `canAccess` would ship on an unstable foundation. Safety net first, then gate features behind it.

### Why Cashflow Filtering/Export (#10-11) after core infra?

Nice-to-have UX polish. Charts (#5-6) deliver 80% of the visual impact. Filtering and export can wait until user feedback confirms demand.

## 📌 Execution Plan

```
Week 1:  #3 Env Validation → #4 SEO Metadata
Week 2:  #5 Cashflow Charts → #6 Cashflow Categories
Week 3:  #7 Vitest + Tests → #8 CI/CD Pipeline
Week 4:  #9 canAccess Gate → #10 Cashflow Filtering
Week 5:  #12 PWA → #13 Sentry
```

> [!TIP]
> Items #10-11 (Cashflow filtering/export) are flexible — slot them in whenever there's downtime or user demand.
> See [CASHFLOW_IMPROVEMENTS.md](./CASHFLOW_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for detailed Cashflow scope per phase.
